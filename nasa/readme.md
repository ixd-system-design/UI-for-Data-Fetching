# NASA APOD - Astronomy Picture of the Day
This Replit demonstrates how a datepicker element can be made into a dynamic control for NASA's APOD API. It uses an Event Listener to monitor for changes to the date picker. It also defines a function `getImage` to do data fetching and display. It includes some logic to handle different situations (e.g. whether we have an image or a video). At the outset it loads a picture for today. 


# Learning Prompts
Fork this Replit and make your own iteration, with some possible improvements:
- Add styling and context to heighten the story.
- Add JavaScript that creates elements for the captions and title of each image.
- Use CSS to optimize the datepicker UI. Research how various browsers implement datepickers.
- Challenge: can you implement a left and right arrow interface that allows users to navigate from one day to the next?
- Challenge: how might you implement a slider interface as an alternate way to choose a date?
- Challenge: How can you avoid showing your API Key in frontend code?
